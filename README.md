# Antivirus_Midterm
Antivirus software for my midterm project.

  Topic: Malware Detection
  Features:
    Signature-Based Detection: User can upload a file and the software will compare the SHA256 hash of the file against a dataset of the 600 most recent malware file hashes that have       been uploaded to a database. 
    Heuristic Analysis: Detects the type of file that is uploaded and will not open the file if it detects that it is an executable
    Process Monitoring: Contains names of some of the most popular virus files and checks the background processes running on the system and reports if those processes are detected.
